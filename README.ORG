* Kren - Analyze Korean-English Language Songs
A small script that aims to visualize and understand K-Pop songs.

- Where does Kr/En appear in a line/verse/section/song
- Proportion
- Comparisons across artists, albums, companies, composers
+ Just consider each hangul block as one syllable?
+ Try to compensate for vowel-ㅇ (다음, 아이)

** Installation
=Kren= is not developed as a formal package. Try to evaluate the =Kren.R=.

Packages required are:
** Getting Started
Search for your favorite songs, looking for its Genius page in original lyrics.

Copy only the lyrics into a file, see =./examples/example-lyrics.txt= for the correct format. Make sure there is an empty line in between each section, and to keep section headers.

#+begin_src R :eval no
  fromis_9._.DM <- lyrics_tree_data("lyrics/fromis_9-DM.txt")
  lyrics_violin(fromis_9._.DM)
  lyrics_smry(fromis_9._.DM, stat = kr_prop, smry_f = mean)
#+end_src

** Inspiration
I have always noticed that K-Pop songs tend to end lines in English, or so I thought. One day, when thinking about this phenomenon, I thought it could be understood through some ruditementary procesing. Thus, =Kren= was born.
** Methods
- Words
- Syllables
- Non-latin characters, such as ae
- Ad-Libs
- Punctuation
** TODOs
*** DONE =raw_df= add in line_beg and line_end
*** DONE Fix colors on =lyrics_chist=
*** DONE =main= Change to something like parse_lyrics
*** DONE =section_tree_to_df= change kr_prop to kr_word_prop
*** DONE =section_tree_to_df= add kr_syllab_prop and kr/total_syllab_cnt
*** DONE =parse_lyrics= Maybe toggle to keep/remove adlibs (things in parentheses)
Need to figure out where (which function) to put interface

#+begin_src R :eval no
gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)","",parse_lyrics(fName)$Chorus.1[[8]])
unlist(strsplit(parse_lyrics(fName)$Chorus.2[[1]], " \\(.*\\)"))
#+end_src
*** TODO Add more statistical analysis interfaces, or flesh out more examples
*** TODO Could look into how repeated sections differ (Chorus)
*** TODO Consider adding metadata into beginning of lyrics file
**** Then need to change parsing and processing
Could Have another folder =metadata= that is one-to-one to =lyrics=
*** TODO Implement ways to process multiple files/folders
**** TODO Then easy ways to compare groups, composers, companies, etc.
Or just leave up to user
*** TODO Formalize interface
The new main can integrate graphs?
Or just leave as a library with some effort required
